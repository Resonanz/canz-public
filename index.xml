      <title>James Veitch: Cornered by Corner?</title>

      <description>From time to time, the press comes out with headlines like &amp;ldquo;Jesus created by Church - lecturer.&amp;rdquo; And so it did in late November 1996.1 It was asimple report in The Evening Post describing briefly Dr Jim Veitch&amp;rsquo;s views and promoting a talk he was to give the following day at St Andrews On The Terrace. This is, of course, precisely where we would expect it to be given. On those occasions when St Andrews is not sponsoring a concert or recital, it will be providing a platform for those who wish to redefine the faith they were ordained to defend.</description>

      <description>Francis Bacon (1561&amp;ndash;1626), widely recognised as the Father of modem science wrote:
&#34;There are two books laid out before us to study to prevent us failing into error: the volume of Scriptures which reveal the will of God and the volume of the creatures.&#34;
The Bible is man&amp;rsquo;s primary source of God&amp;rsquo;s revelation and the &amp;ldquo;volume of the creatures,&amp;rdquo; God&amp;rsquo;s general revelation through nature, proclaims God&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;invisible attributes, His eternal power and godhead&amp;rdquo; (Rom.</description>

      <description>The divine inspiration, infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible, as originally given, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct. The Bible comprises the 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament. The eternal, everlasting, self-existing nature of the Godhead, Who is Maker of the universe, which is separate from, but being finite is completely dependent on Him; Who is both transcendent of and immanent within His creation; Who is the great I AM and Immanuel of the Christian scriptures; Who is Creator and Saviour, Judge and Lover of humankind.</description>

      <title>What is Christian Apologetics?</title>

      <description>No, Christian apologetics doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean saying sorry that you&amp;rsquo;re a Christian. A confusion arises because the English word apology now has a rather different meaning from the Greek word from which it was derived (apologia). Rather, this word literally means &amp;ldquo;out of logic/reason&amp;rdquo;, and refers to a reasoned defence that would be given in a court of law. The classic example is Plato&amp;rsquo;s Apology, Socrates&amp;rsquo; defence against the charges of atheism and corrupting the youth.</description>
